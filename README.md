#  warehouse-management-system

To run the application, you'll need to start both the backend and frontend servers. Open two terminal windows:
**1. In the first terminal (backend):**


```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

**2 .In the second terminal (frontend):**

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

**3 .The backend will run on http://localhost:3001, and the frontend will run on http://localhost:3000. You should now be able to see the Warehouse Management System in your browser.**

**4. Running tests:**

**5. To run the backend tests:**

```bash
cd backend
npm test
```

This project structure provides a solid foundation for the Warehouse Management System. The backend handles data processing and serves the API, while the frontend fetches and displays the data in a simple, user-friendly interface.
Some potential improvements for the future:

**Add more robust error handling and loading states in the frontend.**
Implement pagination for large datasets.
Add authentication and authorization.
Add more features like sorting, filtering, and searching.
Implement real-time updates using WebSockets.
